# Squeakoban

A project I created for the Zenith Game Development club at TAMUC. A working demo of the game, as well as the downloadable exports can be found here: https://shortstack-games.itch.io/squeakoban. However, these are not completely up to date. Right now the scripts on itch.io are behind by one commit or so.

It took me about two or three days to get all the basic mechanics in and draw the assets. Once I felt like I had everything figured out, I populated the game with levels (which exposed some bugs for me), fixed a couple errors with the logic, and added music and sound effects!

I've been cleaning up the code slowly, trying to find new ways to make it simpler, especially the Cheese.gd code when handling movement onto goals. I know there is definitely a way to write it with less if statements/lines, but I haven't found a way I like yet. I've been considering adding a script to the Goal node itself, though that would take some time to figure out and adjust the rest of the code to work with it.
